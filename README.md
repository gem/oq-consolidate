## OQ-Consolidate

OQ-Consolidate is a modified version of [QConsolidate](https://github.com/alexbruy/qconsolidate), that:

- saves raster layers and converts vector layers to GeoPackage.
- creates a project if it does not exist yet
- allows to give a customized (validated) name to the consolidated project
- allows to store all the project files in a zip file

### Installation

# FIXME: No need to make, and perhaps some dependencies are not needed too 

Run `make` first!

It requires `PyQt4-dev`/`PyQt4-devel` and `qt-dev`/`qt-devel` (and looks for `lrelease`. you may need to symlink it).
