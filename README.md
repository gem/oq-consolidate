## oq-consolidate

oq-consolidate is a simplified version of [QConsolidate](https://github.com/alexbruy/qconsolidate):

- supports only vector layers (by design)
- always converts data in GeoPackage format
- creates a project if it does not exist yet

### Installation

Run `make` first!

It requires `PyQt4-dev`/`PyQt4-devel` and `qt-dev`/`qt-devel` (and looks for `lrelease`. you may need to symlink it).
